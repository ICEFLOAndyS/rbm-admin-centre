# RBM Baseline Release Manifest

**Baseline Version:** v2.03  
**Status:** Approved baseline  
**Scope:** Knowledge system, governance, templates, and prompt packs  
**Applies to:** RBM AI Design-to-Code programme  

---

## 1. Purpose

This manifest defines the **authoritative baseline** for the RBM (Runbook Management) knowledge system.
It establishes the **minimum, approved set of artefacts** required to initiate, design, build, and govern RBM features using the multi-agent model.

All future work MUST conform to this baseline unless a governed exception is approved.

## 10. Baseline Rules

- No artefact may contradict authoritative standards.
- No feature may start without product and persona alignment.
- No build may proceed without Orchestrator DoD satisfaction.
- Any deviation from this baseline requires a governed exception.

---

## 11. Change Control

Changes to this baseline require:
- explicit version increment
- decision-log entry
- approval under the Decision Management Standard

---

## Status

This manifest establishes the **RBM Baseline Release v2.03** and is effective immediately.
