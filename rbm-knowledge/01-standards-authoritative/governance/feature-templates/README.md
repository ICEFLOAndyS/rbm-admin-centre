# RBM Feature Templates (Tier-1)

**Authority Level:** Tier-1 (Normative)  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Change Control:** VERSION only

These templates are the ONLY approved boilerplate for creating feature gate artefacts under:
`04-working-non-authoritative/<feature>/`.

## Placeholders
Templates use the following placeholders which MUST be substituted by the scaffolder:
- `{{FEATURE_NAME}}`
- `{{KNOWLEDGE_VERSION}}`
- `{{CREATED_ON}}`
- `{{CREATED_BY}}`

## Status rules
Scaffolding sets each gate artefact to `DRAFT` by default.
A gate artefact may only be changed to `APPROVED` through the approval workflow (PR + reviewers).
