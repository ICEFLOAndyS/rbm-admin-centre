# Gate 0 Bootstrap Guide (Non-Authoritative)

⚠️ **Status: NON-AUTHORITATIVE**

## 1. What Gate 0 Is (and Is Not)

Gate 0 is the entry point to the RBM design-to-code lifecycle.

It exists to:
- confirm feature intent
- establish clear scope boundaries
- ensure readiness for governed progression

Gate 0 does **not**:
- approve designs
- define architecture
- authorise build or execution

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when you:
- want to initiate a new RBM feature
- are unsure what information is required to start
- want to avoid governance rework later

Completing this guide does not initiate work.

---

## 3. What You Need Before Starting

Typically, you will want to have:
- a clear problem statement
- an initial feature name
- an understanding of who the feature is for
- awareness of relevant RBM product areas

Exact requirements are defined in authoritative governance standards.

---

## 4. Preparing Your Feature Intent

Your feature intent usually covers:
- what problem is being addressed
- why the feature is needed
- what is explicitly in scope
- what is explicitly out of scope

An example template is provided separately for convenience.

---

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- starting design or build discussions too early
- skipping scope definition
- assuming governance will be handled later
- treating this guide as a governing artefact

---

## 6. Example Gate 0 Invocation

Correct example:

"Initiate Gate 0 for feature: Event Baselining v2.  
Feature brief is ready for validation."

---

## 7. What Happens After Gate 0

If Gate 0 is validated:
- the Orchestrator will confirm readiness
- the feature will progress to standards conformance checks

If not validated:
- feedback will be provided
- rework may be requested
