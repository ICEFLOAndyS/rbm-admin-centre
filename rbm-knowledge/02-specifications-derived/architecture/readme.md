# RBM Architecture Starter Pack (v2.02)

Generated: 2025-12-28 15:37:30

## Purpose
Provides baseline architecture documents for `02-specifications-derived/architecture/` to support consistent multi-agent delivery.

## Placement
Copy into your repo:
`02-specifications-derived/architecture/`

## Usage
- Orchestrator references these documents to set architecture constraints for features.
- Architects and developers extend these documents without contradicting authoritative standards.
- Feature-level specs (under `02-specifications-derived/features/<feature>/`) must align with this architecture baseline.
