## 1. Purpose
Provides a lightweight index for architecture-level decisions that apply across multiple features.

Feature-specific decisions remain in each feature’s `decision-log.md`.

## 2. ADR list
| ADR ID | Title | Status | Date | Owner | Link |
|-------|-------|--------|------|-------|------|

## 3. Guidance
- Use this file for cross-cutting architectural decisions only.
- All decisions must comply with:
  - `01-standards-authoritative/governance/decision-management-standard.md`
