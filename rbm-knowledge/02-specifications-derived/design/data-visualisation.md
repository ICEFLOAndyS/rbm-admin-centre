## 1. Purpose
Defines RBM visualisation conventions for timelines, progress, and risk indicators.

## 2. Timeline conventions
- Show planned vs actual
- Show baseline markers where applicable
- Highlight critical path / dependencies (where supported)

## 3. Status indicators
- Use consistent status vocabulary across objects
- Avoid relying on colour alone; combine with labels/icons

## 4. Charts and dashboards (guidance)
- Keep charts simple; prioritise operational decisions
- Ensure any dashboard metric has a defined calculation and data source
