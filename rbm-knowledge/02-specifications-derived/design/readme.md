# RBM Design Starter Pack (v2.04)

Generated: 2025-12-28 15:49:13

## Purpose
Provides baseline design documents for `02-specifications-derived/design/` to support consistent multi-agent UX/UI delivery for RBM.

## Placement
Copy into your repo:
`02-specifications-derived/design/`

## Usage
- Orchestrator references these documents to apply design constraints to features.
- UX/UI agents extend and refine these documents without contradicting authoritative standards.
- Feature `ui-spec.md` should align with these design baselines and reference them explicitly.

## Related authoritative standards (examples)
- Governance standards: `01-standards-authoritative/governance/`
- Naming standard: `01-standards-authoritative/rbm-naming/rbm-naming-standard.md`
