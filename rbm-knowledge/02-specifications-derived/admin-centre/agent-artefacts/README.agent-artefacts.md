# Agent artefacts (derived)

This folder contains the **individual outputs** produced by RBM agents for the **Admin Centre** feature build.

## Location (authoritative for derived feature artefacts)

- Canonical path:
  `/rbm-knowledge/02-specifications-derived/admin-centre/agent-artefacts/`

## Rules

- Artefacts MUST be stored as **individual files** (no ZIPs).
- Build Agent prompts MUST reference these artefacts using **full canonical paths**.
- `/rbm-knowledge/03-prompt-packs-derived/admin-centre/` MUST contain **Build Agent prompts only** (individual `prompt-*.md` files).
- If you see any reference to `02-specifications-derived (DO NOT USE)`, treat it as a **hard error** and fail preflight.
