# Programme Manager

## Responsibilities
Delivers complex business and technology programmes while protecting live services. Oversees cutover planning, readiness, rehearsals, and go/no-go governance.

## Primary Interests
- Predictable, low-risk go-lives
- Objective readiness indicators
- Strong cross-party coordination
- Regulatory assurance

## Challenges
- Spreadsheet-based runbooks
- Subjective readiness reporting
- Poor visibility during rehearsals and cutovers

## Key RBM Features
- Readiness scoring
- Rehearsal analytics
- Dependency tracking
- Real-time execution dashboards

## Before vs After
**Before:** Trust-based decisions, delayed go-lives  
**After:** Data-driven readiness and confident execution

## Value Proposition
RBM replaces opinion-based programme decisions with objective, defensible data.

## Discovery Questions
- What processes/tools do you use today to plan and execute major change/DR/service recovery events?
- Where does evidence live, and how quickly can you produce an audit-ready evidence pack?
- How do you manage dependencies across teams and suppliers, and how do you detect/handle variance during execution?
- What are your biggest drivers of delay, rework, or operational risk during critical events?
- What would “good” look like in terms of readiness, predictability, and governance?

## KPIs / Success Measures
- Reduction in change-related incidents and failed changes
- Improved on-time go-live / rehearsal success rate
- Evidence pack cycle time and completeness
- Reduction in manual coordination effort (hours saved)
- Improved audit/regulatory outcomes (fewer findings, faster remediation)

## Regulatory & Assurance Drivers
- FCA/PRA Operational Resilience expectations around governance, testing, and evidence of capability
- EU DORA expectations for ICT risk management, change governance, third-party oversight, and operational resilience testing
- ISO-aligned controls for auditability, traceability, and repeatability (e.g., ISO 27001 / ISO 22301 principles)

## Buying Triggers
- Repeated go-live delays due to low readiness confidence
- Audit/regulatory findings relating to change governance, DR testing, or evidence quality
- Major incidents tied to change or weak recovery execution
- Multi-supplier programmes where coordination and accountability are unclear
- Strategic move to standardise execution on ServiceNow

## Likely Objections
- “We already have a process in spreadsheets / project tools.”
- “Adoption will be hard across teams and suppliers.”
- “We can build something ourselves.”
- “We don’t want another tool.”
- “How do you prove value quickly?”

## Messaging & Positioning
- RBM provides **standardised, ServiceNow-native runbook execution** with **real-time control**, **dependency-aware orchestration**, and **audit-ready evidence**.
- RBM turns high-risk, manual coordination into **predictable, measurable execution**—supporting both delivery velocity and operational resilience.
- RBM reduces operational risk by instrumenting the entire execution lifecycle: **plan → rehearse → execute → evidence → improve**.
