# Runbook Engineer

## Responsibilities
Designs, builds, maintains, and continuously improves executable runbooks used for planned change, disaster recovery, service recovery, cyber recovery, and resilience testing. Translates high-level plans, procedures, and technical steps into structured, dependency-aware, auditable execution artefacts within RBM.

Acts as the bridge between architecture, operations, and execution tooling.

## Primary Interests
- Clear, unambiguous execution logic
- Reusable and standardised runbook patterns
- Accurate dependencies and sequencing
- Low-friction updates and versioning
- Confidence that runbooks will execute as designed under pressure

## Challenges
- Source material scattered across documents, spreadsheets, and emails
- Ambiguous or outdated procedural steps
- Hidden dependencies between systems, teams, and suppliers
- Difficulty validating runbooks outside live events
- Limited feedback loop from rehearsals and real executions

## Key RBM Features
- Structured, executable runbook authoring
- Task sequencing with dependency modelling
- Version control and baselining
- Reusable templates and components
- Separation of plan, rehearsal, and execution modes
- Automated capture of actuals, deviations, and issues

## Before vs After
**Before:**  
Runbooks exist as static documents or spreadsheets, requiring manual interpretation and coordination during execution.

**After:**  
Runbooks are executable assets that drive real-time orchestration, capture evidence automatically, and continuously improve through rehearsal and execution feedback.

## Value Proposition
RBM allows the Runbook Engineer to create **once-designed, repeatedly executable** runbooks that are reliable, testable, and auditable—reducing execution risk and cognitive load during critical events.

## Discovery Questions
- Where do your runbooks currently live, and how often are they updated?
- How do you manage dependencies between tasks, teams, and systems today?
- How do you validate that a runbook will work before a live event?
- How do you capture lessons learned and feed them back into runbooks?
- What causes the most confusion or delay during execution?

## KPIs / Success Measures
- Reduction in execution-time clarifications and escalations
- Reuse rate of runbook templates and components
- Number of defects identified during rehearsals vs live events
- Time taken to update and re-baseline runbooks
- Consistency of execution outcomes across events

## Regulatory & Assurance Drivers
- FCA/PRA Operational Resilience (execution capability and testing)
- DORA ICT risk management and resilience testing
- ISO 22301 principles for continuity planning and exercising
- ISO 27001 principles for controlled operational procedures

## Buying Triggers
- Repeated execution failures or near misses
- Regulatory findings related to change, DR, or testing
- Growth in scale or complexity of change events
- Transition from document-based to executable runbooks
- Desire to standardise execution across teams and suppliers

## Likely Objections
- “This feels like extra overhead compared to documents.”
- “Our engineers already know what to do.”
- “Runbooks change too often to formalise.”
- “We can just automate this ourselves.”

## Messaging & Positioning
- RBM turns runbooks into **executable assets**, not static documentation.
- RBM captures execution knowledge once and makes it repeatable at scale.
- RBM reduces execution risk by making dependencies, status, and deviations visible in real time.
- RBM gives Runbook Engineers a governed, professional discipline rather than ad-hoc documentation.
