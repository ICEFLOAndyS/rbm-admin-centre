# RBM Gate 2 Decision Index

**Scope:** All RBM features (current and future)  
**Knowledge Baseline:** RBM Knowledge v2.03+  
**Authority:** Derived index (references authoritative policies and feature decision logs)

## Purpose
A machine-readable registry of **Gate 2 (Architecture & Data Model)** decisions to:
- enforce consistent Decision ID formats
- support audit and evidence collection
- enable Orchestrator and Build Agent guardrails

## Decision ID Format (MANDATORY)
`G2-DEC-<FEATURE>-<TOPIC>-<NNN>`

- `<FEATURE>`: fixed RBM feature code (e.g., CP, RB, EVT)
- `<TOPIC>`: STATE, MODEL, REL, VERSION, AUDIT, SECURITY, PERF, UPGRADE, EXT
- `<NNN>`: 3-digit sequence (001, 002…)

## Notes
- “PLANNED” entries must be converted to ACTIVE when the feature’s decision log and Gate-2 prompt are updated.
- Add new decisions by appending rows; do not renumber existing IDs.
