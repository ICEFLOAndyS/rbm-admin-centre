This feature is governed by the following authoritative standards:

- 01-standards-authoritative/governance/orchestrator-governance.md
- 01-standards-authoritative/governance/definition-of-done-framework.md
- 01-standards-authoritative/governance/decision-management-standard.md

- 01-standards-authoritative/governance/exception-and-waiver-policy.md
- 01-standards-authoritative/rbm-naming/rbm-naming-standard.md

All feature design, build, validation, and release activities MUST comply with these standards. Any exception requires a formal waiver under the exception-and-waiver policy.

- Standards precedence: `01-standards-authoritative` overrides all derived content
- Auditability: all critical actions must emit auditable events and evidence

## 8. Open questions
