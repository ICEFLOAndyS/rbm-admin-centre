# Agent artefacts (derived)

This folder contains the **individual outputs** produced by RBM agents for this feature build.

## Location (authoritative for derived feature artefacts)

- Canonical path:
  `rbm-knowledge/02-specifications-derived/<feature>/agent-artefacts/`

## Rules

- Artefacts MUST be stored as **individual files** (no ZIPs).
- Build Agent prompts MUST reference these artefacts using **full canonical paths**.
- `rbm-knowledge/03-prompt-packs-derived/<feature>/` MUST contain **Build Agent prompts only** (individual `prompt-*.md` files).
- Any reference to `DEPRECATED-specifications-derived (DO NOT USE)` is a **hard error**.
