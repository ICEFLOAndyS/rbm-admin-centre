# Agent artefacts (derived)

This folder contains the **individual outputs** produced by RBM agents for this feature build.

## Location (authoritative for derived feature artefacts)

- Canonical path:
  `\1` *(Example; replace `admin-centre` per feature.)*admin-centre` per feature.)*`

## Rules

- Artefacts MUST be stored as **individual files** (no ZIPs).
- Build Agent prompts MUST reference these artefacts using **full canonical paths**.
- `\1` *(Example; replace `admin-centre` per feature.)*admin-centre` per feature.)*` MUST contain **Build Agent prompts only** (individual `prompt-*.md` files).
- Any reference to `02-specifications-derived (DO NOT USE)` is a **hard error**.
